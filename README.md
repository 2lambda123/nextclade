# webclades

This app is a simple web-tool to assign Nextstrain clade to the SARS-CoV-2 sequences.
It is not currently deployed anywhere and is very much work in progress.

To run in locally in development mode, do:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
cd packages/web
yarn install
yarn dev
```
which should serve the app on port `3000`.
