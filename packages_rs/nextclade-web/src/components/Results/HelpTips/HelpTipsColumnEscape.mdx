##### Column: Escape

This column displays neutralizing antibody escape for antibodies relative to BA.2

The remaining antibody fraction can be calculated as exp(-escape_score). An escape value of 0 means all binding is retained. A value of 1 means e^(-1)=0.4 of binding is retained. A value of 2 means ~17% of binding is retained etc.

Note that the score does not distinguish between amino acids that are subsituted, so S:346T has the same score as S:346I.

Note that only RBD mutations are considered, defined as mutations between S:330 and S:531. Mutations outside this range are ignored.

Note that this escape calculator counts reversions to reference as mutations. Thus bad quality sequences could potentially get high scores. Also, non-BA.2/4/5* derived sequences will not get a correct escape score. If it says "outgroup" as clade, the scape score is not valid.

The score is calculated using the same logic as Bloom lab's antibody escape calculator using data generated by their and Yunlong Cao's group.
