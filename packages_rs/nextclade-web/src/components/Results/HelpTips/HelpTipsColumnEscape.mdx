##### Column: Escape

This column displays neutralizing antibody escape for antibodies relative to BA.2

The remaining antibody fraction can be calculated as exp(-escape_score). An escape value of 0 means all binding is retained. A value of 1 means e^(-1)=0.4 of binding is retained. A value of 2 means ~17% of binding is retained etc.

Note that the score does not distinguish between amino acids that are subsituted, so S:346T has the same score as S:346I.

Note that only RBD mutations are considered, defined as mutations between S:330 and S:531. Mutations outside this range are ignored.

The score is calculated using the same logic as Bloom lab's antibody escape calculator using data generated by their and Yunlong Cao's group.
