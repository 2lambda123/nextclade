##### Column: row index

Index of the row in the table. Useful for visual counting of sorted and filtered results.

Not to be confused with sequence index.

Row indices always start with 0 and are sorted in ascending order, and do not change their position when sorting or filtering of the results.

Indices are 0-based.
