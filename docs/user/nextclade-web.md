# Nextclade web app

Nextclade web is available online at [clades.nextstrain.org](https://clades.nextstrain.org). This is the easiest way of using Nextclade and is the recommended way to get started.

Drag a fasta file onto the "upload" box, provide a url or paste sequence data directly into the text box. The sequences will then be analyzed right in your browser - data never leaves your computer (i.e. no actual "upload" is happening). Since your computer is doing the computational work rather than a remote server, it is advisable to analyze at most a few hundred of sequences at a time, depending on yor hardware.

Power users might want to switch to "Advanced mode" in order to get access to more configuration. This mode is equivalent to using the Nextclade command-line tool and accepts the same input files (see "inputs" section) <!--- Need to link to CLI docs here -->.

The simple mode ("non-advanced") of the web application currently only supports SARS-CoV-2 sequences, but we are extending the tool to influenza and hopefully other pathogens in the future.

## Getting started

The quickest way to explore Nextclade web is to open [clades.nextstrain.org](https://clades.nextstrain.org) in your browser. We recommend you use Firefox or a Chromium based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, etc.), since these are the browser we officially support. Then click on "Show me an example", if you don't want to upload your own SARS-CoV-2 FASTA file.
