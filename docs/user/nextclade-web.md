### Web application

Nextclade Web is available online at [clades.nextstrain.org](https://clades.nextstrain.org). This is the easiest way of using it and is a recommended way to get started.

Drag a fasta file onto the "upload" box, provide a url or paste sequence data directly into the text box. The sequences will then be analyzed right in your browser - data never leaves your computer (i.e. no actual "upload" is happening). Since your computer is doing the computational work rather than a remote server, it is advisable to analyze at most a few hundred of sequences at a time, depending on yor hardware.

Power users might want to switch to "Advanced mode" in order to get access to more configuration. This mode is equivalent to using Nextclade command-line tool and accepts the same input files (see "Inputs" section).

Simple mode of the web application currently only supports SARS-CoV-2, but we will hopefully extend the tool to other pathogens in the future.
