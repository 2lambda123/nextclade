# Nextclade

## What is Nextclade?

Nextclade is a tool that identifies differences between your sequences and a reference sequence used by Nextstrain, uses these differences to assign your sequences to clades, and reports potential sequence quality issues in your data. You can use the tool to analyze sequences before you upload them to a database, or if you want to assign Nextstrain clades to a set of sequences.

## How to obtain Nextclade?

Nextclade is available as a web application and as a command-line tool. The source code of the algorithm is shared between both versions, they consume the same inputs and produce the same outputs.
