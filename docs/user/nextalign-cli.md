# Nextalign CLI

Nextalign CLI is a viral genome sequence alignment tool for command line. It uses the same algorithm that is used in [Nextclade Web](nextclade-web) and [Nextclade CLI](nextclade-cli).

You can learn more about the algorithm in the [Algorithm](algorithm) section (Nextalign algorithms is limited to alignment and translation steps).

This section describes:

- how to install Nextalign CLI - using Docker container and natively
- how to run Nextalign CLI with sample data
- what other sections of the documentation are worth checking after that

## Installation (with docker)

Container images are available at Docker Hub: üêã [nextstrain/nextalign](https://hub.docker.com/r/nextstrain/nextalign)

Pull and run the latest version with:

```bash
docker pull nextstrain/nextalign:latest
docker run -it --rm nextstrain/nextalign:latest nextalign --help
```

Pull and run a specific version with:

```bash
docker run -it --rm nextstrain/nextalign:2.0.0 nextalign --help
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏èDon't forget to mount necessary [docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) to be able to supply the data into the container and to access the results. You may want to also add [`--user` argument](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) to docker command, to run on behalf of a non-root user and group. This is not specific to Nextclade. Please refer to Docker documentation for more details.

Docker images are available based on:

- `debian` (default): Nextclade executable + a set of basic Linux utilities, such as `bash`, `curl` and `wget`, to facilitate usage in workflows
- `alpine`: pure Alpine + Nextclade executable
- `scratch`: empty image + Nextclade executable

You can choose to use the latest available version (`:latest` or no tag), or to freeze a specific version (e.g. `:2.0.0`) or only major version (e.g. `:2`), or a base image (e.g. `:debian`) or both version and base image (e.g. `:2.0.0-debian`), or mix and match.

Tag `:latest` points to `:debian`.

## Installation (local)

### Download manually

You can download the latest version of Nextalign CLI for your platform using one of these direct links:

- ‚¨áÔ∏è [Nextalign for Linux (x86_64)](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextalign/releases/latest/download/nextalign-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)
- ‚¨áÔ∏è [Nextalign for macOS (Intel, x86_64)](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextalign/releases/latest/download/nextalign-x86_64-apple-darwin)
- ‚¨áÔ∏è [Nextalign for macOS (Apple Silicon, ARM64)](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextalign/releases/latest/download/nextalign-aarch64-apple-darwin)
- ‚¨áÔ∏è [Nextalign for Windows (x86_64)](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextalign/releases/latest/download/nextclade-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.exe)

All versions and their release notes are available on üêà [Github Releases](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade/releases).

These executables are self-contained and don't require any dependencies. They can be renamed and moved freely. It is convenient to rename the executable to `nextclade` and to move to one of the directories included in system `$PATH`, so that it's available from any directory in the console.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note that macOS executables are not currently signed with a developer certificate (it requires maintaining a paid Apple developer account). Recent versions of macOS might refuse to run the executable. Before invoking Nextalign on command line, follow these steps to add Nextalign to the exclude list:
> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac">
> macOS User Guide: Open a Mac app from an unidentified developer</a>, and check <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491">
> Security settings</a>. Refer to the latest macOS documentation if none of this works.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **GNU vs musl.** Nextalign has two flavors of executables for Linux: "gnu" and "musl", depending on what libc is used. We recommend "gnu" flavor by default - it is typically faster. However, if for some reason "gnu" flavor does not work, try "musl".

### Using conda

> ‚ö†Ô∏èNote that new versions may appear on bioconda with some delay (hours to weeks)

A [Nextalign conda package]((https://anaconda.org/bioconda/nextalign)) is available for Linux and macOS from the `conda` channel `bioconda`:

```bash
conda install -c bioconda nextalign
```

## Usage

Refer to help prompt for usage of Nextalign:

```bash
nextalign --help
nextalign run --help
```

## Quick Example

1. Download the example SARS-CoV-2 data files from [GitHub](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade_data/tree/master/data/datasets/sars-cov-2/references/MN908947/versions/2021-10-11T19:00:32Z/files)
   (You can also try other viruses in the `data/` directory)

2. Run:

   ```bash
   nextalign \
     --input-ref=data/sars-cov-2/reference.fasta \
     --genemap=data/sars-cov-2/genemap.gff \
     --output-all=output/ \
     data/sars-cov-2/sequences.fasta
   ```

   Add `-v` to show more information in the console. Add `--include-reference` flag to also write gap-stripped reference sequence and peptides into outputs.

3. Find the output files in the `output/` directory:

- `nextalign.aligned.fasta` - aligned input sequences
- `nextalign.gene_<gene_name>.translation.fasta` - aligned peptides corresponding to each gene

Congratulations, You have learned how to use Nextalign CLI!

Going further, you might want to learn about the science behind the Nextalign internals in the [Algorithm](algorithm) section. The required input data is described in [Input files](input-files) section. And produced files are described in [Output files](output-files) section.
