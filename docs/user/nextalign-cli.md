# Nextalign CLI

Nextalign CLI is a viral genome sequence alignment tool for command line. It uses the same algorithm that is used in [Nextclade Web](nextclade-web) and [Nextclade CLI](nextclade-cli).

You can learn more about the algorithm in the [Algorithm: Sequence alignment](algorithm.html#sequence-alignment) section.

This section describes:

- how to install Nextalign CLI - using Docker container and natively
- how to run Nextalign CLI with sample data
- what other sections of the documentation are worth checking after that

## Installation (with docker)

Container images are available at Docker Hub: üêã [nextstrain/nextalign](https://hub.docker.com/r/nextstrain/nextalign)

Pull and run the latest version with:

```bash
docker pull nextstrain/nextalign:latest
docker run -it --rm nextstrain/nextalign:latest nextalign --help
```

Pull and run a specific version with:

```bash
docker run -it --rm nextstrain/nextalign:2.0.0 nextalign --help
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏èDon't forget to mount necessary [docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) to be able to supply the data into the container and to access the results. You may want to also add [`--user` argument](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) to docker command, to run on behalf of a non-root user and group. This is not specific to Nextclade. Please refer to Docker documentation for more details.

Docker images are available based on:

- `debian` (default): Nextclade executable + a set of basic Linux utilities, such as `bash`, `curl` and `wget`, to facilitate usage in workflows
- `alpine`: pure Alpine + Nextclade executable
- `scratch`: empty image + Nextclade executable

You can choose to use the latest available version (`:latest` or no tag), or to freeze a specific version (e.g. `:2.0.0`) or only major version (e.g. `:1`), or a base image (e.g. `:debian`) or both version and base image (e.g. `:2.0.0-debian`), or mix and match.

Tag `:latest` points to `:debian`.

## Installation (local)

### Using conda

A [Nextalign conda package]((https://anaconda.org/bioconda/nextalign)) is available for Linux and macOS from the `conda` channel `bioconda`:

```bash
conda install -c bioconda nextalign
```

### Download manually

You can download the latest version of Nextalign CLI for your platform using one of these direct links:

- ‚¨áÔ∏è [Nextalign for Linux (x86_64)](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextalign/releases/latest/download/nextalign-Linux-x86_64)
- ‚¨áÔ∏è [Nextalign for macOS (Intel, x86_64)](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextalign/releases/latest/download/nextalign-MacOS-x86_64)
- ‚¨áÔ∏è [Nextalign for macOS (Apple Silicon, ARM64)](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextalign/releases/latest/download/nextalign-MacOS-arm64)

All versions and their release notes are available on üêà [Github Releases](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade/releases).

These executables are self-contained and don't require any dependencies. They can be renamed and moved freely. It is convenient to rename the executable to `nextclade` and to move to one of the directories included in system `$PATH`, so that it's available from any directory in the console.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note that macOS executables are not currently signed with a developer certificate (it requires maintaining a paid Apple developer account). Recent versions of macOS might refuse to run the executable. Before invoking Nextalign on command line, follow these steps to add Nextalign to the exclude list:
> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac">
macOS User Guide: Open a Mac app from an unidentified developer</a>, and check <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491">
Security settings</a>. Refer to the latest macOS documentation if none of this works.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Native Windows executables are not available at this time. Windows users can try one of the following:
>
> - Download the Linux executable (see above) and run it under [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
> - Use [Docker container image](#installation-with-docker)
> - Rent a Linux machine, for example at a cloud compute provider or on premises of your organization or university

## Usage

Refer to help prompt for usage of Nextalign:

```bash
nextalign --help
nextalign run --help
```

## Quick Example

1. Download the example SARS-CoV-2 data files from [GitHub](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade_data/tree/master/data/datasets/sars-cov-2/references/MN908947/versions/2021-10-11T19:00:32Z/files)
    (You can also try other viruses in the `data/` directory)

2. Run:

   ```bash
   nextalign \
     --input-ref=data/sars-cov-2/reference.fasta \
     --genemap=data/sars-cov-2/genemap.gff \
     --output-all=output/ \
     data/sars-cov-2/sequences.fasta
   ```

   Add `-v` to show more information in the console. Add `--include-reference` flag to also write gap-stripped reference sequence and peptides into outputs.

3. Find the output files in the `output/` directory:

    - `nextalign.aligned.fasta` - aligned input sequences
    - `nextalign.gene_<gene_name>.translation.fasta` - aligned peptides corresponding to each gene
