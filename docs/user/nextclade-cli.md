# Nextclade CLI

Nextclade is a tool that identifies differences between your sequences and a reference sequence, uses these differences to assign your sequences to clades, and reports potential sequence quality issues in your data. You can use the tool to analyze sequences before you upload them to a database, or if you want to assign Nextstrain clades to a set of sequences.

You can learn more about the algorithm in the [Algorithm](algorithm) section.

This section describes:

- how to install Nextclade CLI - using Docker, as a standalone executable, or using conda
- how to run Nextclade CLI with sample data
- what other sections of the documentation are worth checking after that

## Installation

### Conda

> ‚ö†Ô∏èNote that new versions may appear on bioconda with some delay (hours to days)

A [Nextclade conda package](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/nextclade) is available for Linux and macOS from the `conda` channel `bioconda`:

```bash
conda install -c bioconda nextclade
```

Use `mamba` instead of `conda` for faster installation. Bioconda does not support arm64 architectures yet. So if you want maximum performance (~2x speedup) use the standalone executable or compile from source.

### Standalone executable

#### Download manually

You can download the latest version of Nextclade CLI for your platform using one of these direct links:

- ‚¨áÔ∏è [nextclade for Linux (x86_64)](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade/releases/latest/download/nextclade-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)
- ‚¨áÔ∏è [nextclade for macOS (Intel, x86_64)](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade/releases/latest/download/nextclade-x86_64-apple-darwin)
- ‚¨áÔ∏è [nextclade for macOS (Apple Silicon, ARM64)](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade/releases/latest/download/nextclade-aarch64-apple-darwin)
- ‚¨áÔ∏è [nextclade for Windows (x86_64)](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade/releases/latest/download/nextclade-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.exe)

All versions and their release notes are available on üêà [Github Releases](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade/releases).

These executables are self-contained and don't require any dependencies. They can be renamed and moved freely. It is convenient to rename the executable to `nextclade` and to move to one of the directories included in system `$PATH`, so that it's available from any directory in the console.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note that macOS executables are not currently signed with a developer certificate (it requires maintaining a paid Apple developer account). Recent versions of macOS might refuse to run the executable. Before invoking Nextclade on command line, follow these steps to add Nextclade to the exclude list:
> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac">
> macOS User Guide: Open a Mac app from an unidentified developer</a>, and check <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491">
> Security settings</a>. Refer to the latest macOS documentation if none of this works.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **GNU vs musl.** Nextclade has two flavors of executables for Linux: "gnu" and "musl", depending on what libc is used. We recommend "gnu" flavor by default - it is typically faster. However, if for some reason "gnu" flavor does not work, try "musl".

### Docker

Container images are available at Docker Hub: üêã [nextstrain/nextclade](https://hub.docker.com/r/nextstrain/nextclade)

Pull and run the latest released version with:

```bash
docker pull nextstrain/nextclade:latest
docker run -it --rm nextstrain/nextclade:latest nextclade --help
```

Pull and run a specific version with:

```bash
docker run -it --rm nextstrain/nextclade:2.0.0 nextclade --help
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏èDon't forget to mount necessary [docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) to be able to supply the data into the container and to access the results. You may want to also add [`--user` argument](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) to docker command, to run on behalf of a non-root user and group. This is not specific to Nextclade. Please refer to Docker documentation for more details.

E.g. to run Nextclade on a single file `my_sequences.fasta` in your current directory auto-downloading the `nextstrain/sars-cov-2/MN908947` dataset and outputting into the `output/` directory in your current folder:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/data nextstrain/nextclade nextclade run -D nextstrain/sars-cov-2/MN908947 data/my_sequences.fasta --output-all data/output
```

Docker images are available based on:

- `debian` (default): Nextclade executable + a set of basic Linux utilities, such as `bash`, `curl` and `wget`, to facilitate usage in workflows
- `alpine`: pure Alpine + Nextclade executable
- `scratch`: empty image + Nextclade executable

You can choose to use the latest available version (`:latest` or no tag), or to freeze a specific version (e.g. `:2.0.0`) or only major version (e.g. `:2`), or a base image (e.g. `:debian`) or both version and base image (e.g. `:2.0.0-debian`), or mix and match.

Tag `:latest` points to `:debian`.

### Build from source

If you have an architecture for which we don't provide a binary (e.g. Windows/Linux on ARM64, you can always build Nextclade from source This is most easily done using `cargo` (as Nextclade is written in Rust).

Install Rust, e.g. using `rustup`, see [docs](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Clone the repository (default is `master` branch which could be unstable):

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade.git nextclade
cd nextclade
```

Copy the default `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Build the executable:

```bash
 cargo install --path packages_rs/nextclade-cli
```

If you will only ever use the executable on the current machine, you can use it with all features supported by your CPU for maximum performance:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo install --path packages_rs/nextclade-cli
```

Cargo puts the executable at the following path: `~/.cargo/bin/nextclade`.

## Usage

Refer to the help prompt for usage of Nextclade:

```bash
nextclade
```

Each subcommand has its own help prompt:

```bash
nextclade run --help
nextclade dataset --help
nextclade dataset list --help
nextclade dataset get --help
nextclade sort --help
nextclade read-annotation
```

<!--- TODO: Should be expanded with detailed explanation of the commands -->

## Quick start

1. Download a SARS-CoV-2 dataset:

   ```bash
   nextclade dataset get --name 'nextstrain/sars-cov-2/MN908947' --output-dir 'data/sars-cov-2'
   ```

   Observe downloaded dataset files in the directory `data/sars-cov-2/`

   > üí°Ô∏è This command will download the latest SARS-CoV-2 dataset. You should run it periodically to update the dataset, in order to get the latest features, including the most up-to-date clade assignment. Find out more in the [Nextclade datasets](datasets) section.

2. Run using the downloaded dataset and its example sequences (`data/sars-cov-2/sequences.fasta`):

   ```bash
   nextclade run \
      --input-dataset data/sars-cov-2 \
      --output-all=output/ \
      data/sars-cov-2/sequences.fasta
   ```

   Try to provide your own data instead of `data/sars-cov-2/sequences.fasta`.

   For more controls, specify input files explicitly and/or add more flags for output files:

   ```bash
   nextclade run \
      --verbose \
      --include-reference \
      --in-order \
      --input-dataset=data/sars-cov-2 \
      --input-ref=data/sars-cov-2/reference.fasta \
      --input-annotation=data/sars-cov-2/genome_annotation.gff3 \
      --genes=E,M,N,ORF1a,ORF1b,ORF3a,ORF6,ORF7a,ORF7b,ORF8,ORF9b,S \
      --input-tree=data/sars-cov-2/tree.json \
      --input-pathogen-json=data/sars-cov-2/pathogen.json \
      --output-fasta=output/nextclade.aligned.fasta.gz \
      --output-json=output/nextclade.json \
      --output-ndjson=output/nextclade.ndjson \
      --output-csv=output/nextclade.csv \
      --output-tsv=output/nextclade.tsv \
      --output-tree=output/nextclade.auspice.json \
      --output-tree-nwk=output/nextclade.tree.nwk \
      --output-translations=output/nextclade_gene_{gene}.translation.fasta.zst \
      data/sars-cov-2/sequences.fasta \
      my_sequences1.fasta.gz \
      my_sequences2.fasta.xz
   ```

   Add the `--verbose` flag to show more information in the console. Add `--include-reference` flag to also write gap-stripped reference sequence and reference peptides into outputs. Add `--in-order` to preserve the same order of results in output files as in input fasta (has runtime performance cost).

   The `--input-dataset` argument can be combined with individual `--input*` args. In this case, individual args override the corresponding files in the dataset.

   If `--output-all` is used, you can set `--output-basename` to control filenames and `--output-selection=all,fasta,json,ndjson,csv,tsv,tree,translations,insertions,errors` to control which files are emitted.

   There are more advanced arguments to control alignment and other parts of the algorithm. Refer to `nextclade run --help` for more details.

   You can learn more about input and output files in sections: [Input files](input-files), [Output files](output-files) and [Nextclade datasets](datasets). Read the built-in help (`nextclade --help`) for a detailed description of each subcommand and each flag.

3. Find the output files in the `output/` directory:

- `nextclade.aligned.fasta` - aligned input sequences
- `nextclade_gene_<gene_name>.translation.fasta` - aligned peptides corresponding to each gene
- `nextclade.tsv` - results of the analysis in TSV format
- `nextclade.csv` - same results, but in CSV format
- `nextclade.json` - detailed results of the analysis in JSON format
- `nextclade.ndjson` - detailed results of the analysis in newline-delimited JSON format
- `nextclade.auspice.json` - same as input tree, but with the input sequences placed onto it and in Auspice v2 JSON format
- `nextclade.tree.nwk` - same as input tree, but with the input sequences placed onto it and in Newick format
