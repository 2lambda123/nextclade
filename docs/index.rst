================================================================================

Nextclade is an open-source project for viral genome alignment, mutation calling, clade assignment, quality checks and phylogenetic placement.
It is available as a web application at `clades.nextstrain.org <https://clades.nextstrain.org>`_ (we call it Nextclade Web), as well as a command-line tool (Nextclade CLI).

Nextclade is a part of `Nextstrain <https://nextstrain.org>`_, an open-source project to harness the scientific and public health potential of pathogen genome data. All source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade>`_.
