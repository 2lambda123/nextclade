This package contains static library called `libnextalign`, which contains the implementation of Nextalign algorithms.

You are probably more interested in the command-line executable, which is in package <a href="../../nextalign_cli">nextalign_cli</a>. See readme file there for more details.

See also ["Developer's guide: Nextclade CLI and Nextalign CLI"](docs/dev/developers-guide-cli.md) for instructions on how to build and run the CLI modules.

Currently we don't support usage of this library outside `nextalign_cli`, `nextclade_cli` and `nextclade_wasm`, but it does not mean it's impossible. If you want to build a project on top of `nextalign`, we would be glad to hear about your use-case and experience.
