## Nextstrain SARS-CoV-2 Clades

Since its emergence in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has diversified into several different co-circulating variants. To
facilitate discussion of these variants, we have grouped them into so called clades which are defined by specific
signature mutations.

We currently define 5 major clades (see
[this blog post](https://nextstrain.org/blog/2020-06-02-SARSCoV2-clade-naming) for details):

- 19A and 19B emerged in Wuhan and have been dominating the early outbreak
- 20A emerged from 19A out of dominated the European outbreak in March and has since spread globally
- 20B and 20C are large genetically distinct subclades 20A

## Clade assignment

The analysis on [nextstrain.org/ncov](https://nextstrain.org/ncov) uses the phylogenetic context to assign clades. Here,
we provide a simple tool to do this clade assignment sequence-by-sequence through alignment to the reference. This is
expected to be slightly less sensitive, but will still give the correct answer in most cases. Sometimes, however, clade
assignment will fail. Importantly, these computations happen on your computer and ** your data does not leave your
computer**

## Sequence quality control (QC)

In addition to assigning clades, the tool will scan your sequences for excess divergence and clusters of differences
from the reference. These might indicate problems during sequencing or bioinformatic assembly and would result in these
sequences being filtered out by nextstrain.
