##### Column: frame shifts

Displays total length of unexpected reading frame shifts in the sequence. Shifted ranges are expressed in codon coordinates of the affected gene.

Hovering mouse over a cell in this column will display a tooltip with detailed information about the detected frame shift ranges for each gene.

Note that the dataset authors may define a list of known good (expected) frame shifts in the quality control (QC) configuration. These frame shifts are not included in the displayed number and are listed separately in the tooltip.

Positions are 1-based.
