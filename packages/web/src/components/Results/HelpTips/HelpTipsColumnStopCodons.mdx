##### Column: premature stop codons

Displays number of unexpected premature stop codons in the sequence.

Hovering mouse over a cell in this column will display a tooltip with detailed information about the detected premature stop codons in each gene.

Note that the dataset authors may define a list of known good (expected) premature stop codons in the quality control (QC) configuration. These stop codons are not included in the displayed number and are listed separately in the tooltip.

The meaning of the notation with parenteses: first number is a number of unexpected changes and the second is grand total (unexpected + known).

The usual stop condons at the end of genes (as defined by the reference sequence) are never counted or displayed in this column.

Positions are 1-based.
