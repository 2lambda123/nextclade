DEPRECATED

### Deprecated? What does it mean?

Nextclade version 0.x is deprecated. It means that we no longer recommend to use it.

Please upgrade to the most recent version, containing latest bug fixes and new features. Make sure you remove the old version to avoid conflicts.

The latest information and installation instructions are available:

 - in Nextclade Web application: https://clades.nextstrain.org/
 - in official documentation: https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade/en/stable/
 - on GitHub: https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade

### What if I REALLY need to install Nextclade 0.x?

This is NOT RECOMMENDED, but you can specify version 0.14.4 explicitly when installing:

```bash
npm install --global @nextstrain/nextclade@0.14.4
```
