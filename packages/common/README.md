# Common

Helper package containing common functions used in other packages

Contains functionality shared across all other packages. Mostly very generic and lightweight things, like small utilities and extensions to standard library. This package should not get any large dependencies, because they will propagate to all packages, whether they need them or not.

If you are looking for a place where to start getting familiar with the codebase, this is NOT the right place. Instead, take a look at packages with `_cli` at the end.
